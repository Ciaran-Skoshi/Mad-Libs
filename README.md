Skoshi's Mad Libs terminal game
===============================

How to play:
------------
Make a folder in the same folder you have "main.py" downloaded in named "madLibs" (case sensitive) and put your Mad Libs in it! Then just run "main.py" through a [Python 3 interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and play!

How to make a Mad Lib:
----------------------
Just make a file in the madLibs folder and write whatever you want, using [] for words you wish to be filled in e.g. [Adjectived], [Noun (plural)], [Verb ending in ing], etc. and save it! (Make sure your file has a ".txt" at the end or it will not be detected)
